### Reflections and Comments

#### LAB - 08 Reflections

* Overall the project went well I followed along in class and then recreated the same layout using CSS Grid. I also had some issues with the links to the sample images so I included them in the project itself.

* How do I get the footer to stick to the bottom of the page in mobile using CSS Grid?

* In all this assignment took around 4 hours tom complete, but I spent spent about half of that reworking it to work with CSS Grid. This was inline with my expectations of using some grid methods I hadn't applied previously.
